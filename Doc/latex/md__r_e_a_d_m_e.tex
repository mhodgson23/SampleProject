Sample Project Using OO with Agents to Optimize Behavior

Intent Project sets up clusters of wind turbines and simulates power output as compared to estimated power consumption as well as natural and physical phenoma to determine overall efficiency of output power. This is an optimization problem wherein the code determines the most cost-\/effective improvement to the wind turbine farms.

Make Notes Used windows with Min\+G\+W-\/32 but copied minggw32-\/make.\+exe to be called make.\+exe such that the make process would be the same for windows or Linux, barring file type extensions.
