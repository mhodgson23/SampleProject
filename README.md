# SampleProject
Sample Project Using OO with Agents to Optimize Behavior

Intent
Project sets up clusters of wind turbines and simulates power output as compared to estimated
power consumption as well as natural and physical phenoma to determine overall efficiency of output
power.  This is an optimization problem wherein the code determines the most cost-effective improvement
to the wind turbine farms.

Note that wind turbine data is sourced from here:

To Clone Project:
Download and install GIT from https://git-scm.com/downloads
Clone via command line using the following command where <path> is the desired cloning path:
git clone https://github.com/mhodgson23/SampleProject.git <path>

Make Notes
Used windows with MinGW-32 but copied minggw32-make.exe to be called make.exe such that the make process
would be the same for windows or Linux, barring file type extensions.
